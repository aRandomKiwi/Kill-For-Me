 Rust package for low frequency communication. 

First, let's define the requirements for the package. For low frequency communication, we can use radio waves with frequencies in the range of 30 kHz to 300 kHz. We need to be able to transmit and receive data reliably over long distances, with low power consumption. We also need to ensure that the signal is immune to noise and interference.

One common approach for low frequency communication is to use amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulation, which encodes data in the amplitude of the radio wave. We can use a simple on-off keying (OOK) scheme, where a high amplitude represents a "1" bit and a low amplitude represents a "0" bit.

With these requirements in mind, we can start implementing the Rust package. Here's a basic outline of the package:

1. Define a `Radio` struct that represents the low frequency radio hardware. This struct should have methods for configuring and controlling the radio, such as setting the frequency and power level.

2. Define a `Transmitter` struct that represents the data transmitter. This struct should have a method for sending data over the radio, using the OOK scheme. The method should take a byte array or string as input, and convert it to an amplitude-modulated radio wave.

3. Define a `Receiver` struct that represents the data receiver. This struct should have a method for receiving data from the radio, using a matched filter to detect the OOK signal. The method should return the received data as a byte array or string.

4. Implement error checking and handling in the `Transmitter` and `Receiver` methods. For example, the `Transmitter` method should check that the input data is within the allowed size and format, and the `Receiver` method should check that the received signal is valid and has the expected format.

5. Test the package with various scenarios, such as transmitting and receiving data over different distances and in the presence of noise and interference.

Here's a skeleton code for the package:

```rust
pub struct Radio {
    // TODO: Define radio hardware parameters and methods
}

pub struct Transmitter {
    radio: Radio,
    // TODO: Define transmitter parameters and methods
}

impl Transmitter {
    pub fn send_data(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), String> {
        // TODO: Convert data to an amplitude-modulated radio wave and send it over the radio
        // Check for errors and return a Result
    }
}

pub struct Receiver {
    radio: Radio,
    // TODO: Define receiver parameters and methods
}

impl Receiver {
    pub fn receive_data(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
        // TODO: Receive an amplitude-modulated radio wave from the radio and detect the OOK signal
        // Check for errors and return a Result with the received data
    }
}
```

This is just a starting point for the package, and you will need to fill in the details based on your specific requirements and hardware setup. Good luck!
