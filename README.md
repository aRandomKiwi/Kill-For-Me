# Kill For Me
Teach your animals to kill enemies in packs

**Unlike vanilla release animal training**, you do not risk life of colonists, get full controls over your packs movements (and therefore the ability to create attack strategies) and choosing targets to kill plus many other advantages and customizations (attack buildings, ranged attack support for modded animals, bonus attack system, hierarchy system...).

Please [watch the tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P366jkzZErA) and [read the FAQ topic](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1629854111/1843566500515760775/) to use the mod correctly.

## Important mods order

It is adviced to place Kill For Me just after HugsLib or Core.

For players having weird bugs, non attacking animals in their pack, or animals which try to kill already killed targets, most of the time this comes from a bad mod order caused by some unknown mods incompatibilities, to solve this issue, try bring kill for me just after HugsLib (if you have it) otherwise just after the Core and retry it should fix your issue.

Note : If you have Hunt For Me too please bring it too in the same order that currently (eg : Core > HugsLib > (Kill For Me > Hunt For Me) or (Hunt For Me > Kill For Me if it was in this order) )
